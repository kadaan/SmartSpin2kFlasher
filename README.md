# SmartSpin2kFlasher [![Build](https://github.com/kadaan/SmartSpin2kFlasher/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kadaan/SmartSpin2kFlasher/actions/workflows/build.yml)

SmartSpin2kFlasher is a utility app for the [SmartSpin2k](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2K)
framework and is designed to make flashing ESPs with SmartSpin2K as simple as possible by:

 * Having pre-built binaries for most operating systems.
 * Hiding all non-essential options for flashing. All necessary options for flashing
   (bootloader, flash mode) are automatically extracted from the binary.

This project was originally intended to be a simple command-line tool,
but then I decided that a GUI would be nice. As I don't like writing graphical
front end code, the GUI largely is based on the
[ESPHome-Flasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher)
project.

The flashing process is done using the [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool)
library by espressif.

## Linux Notes

Installing wxpython for linux can be a bit challenging (especially when you don't want to install from source).
You can use the following command to install a wxpython suitable with your OS:

```bash
# Go to https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ and select the correct OS type
# here, we assume ubuntu 18.03 bionic
pip3 install -U \
    -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-18.04 \
    wxPython
```
